#LET US LEARN ABOUT DATA TYPES
J = "i AM A GIRL"  #string

# k = 5 #integer
# l = 70.5 #float
# Python allows you to assign values to multiple variables in one line
# b,v,c= "mimi","nini","lili"
# print(v) 
# And you can assign the same value to multiple variables in one line
# s=d=f="one value to multiple variables"
# print(d)

#GLOBAL VARIABLES
# Variables that are created outside of a function (as in all of the examples above) are known as global variables.
# Global variables can be used by everyone, both inside of functions and outside.
# s = "HELLO"

# def myFunction():
#     print(s + " TO YOU ALL")

# myFunction()
#Normally, when you create a variable inside a function, that variable is local, and can only be used inside that function.
# To create a global variable inside a function, you can use the global keyword.

#SRINGS ARE ARRAYS
# y="Happy"
# print(y[1])
#looping through a string
# for z in "apple":
#     print(z)
#To get the length of a string
# q = "Olamide"
# print(len(q))
#To check if a certain phrase or character is present in a string, we can use the keyword in
# text = "I am a Jesus kind of girl"
# print("Jesus" in text)

# python lists
list=['one','two','three']
print(list)

#Python Boolean
#Almost any value is true if it has some sort of content
#Empty values are false
print(bool("bannana"))
print(bool())
print(bool(None))
print(bool(False))
print(bool({}))

#Python Lists
#list is ordered and changeable. It allows duplicate members too.... negative index means from the end -1 refers to the last item -2
#  refers to the second last item
thislist = ["apple","banana","apple","guava","orange","cherry"]
print(thislist)
print(thislist[1])
# len is used to determine how many items a list has
# print(len(thislist))
# print(thislist[2:5])

#python Tuple is ordered and unchangeable and unindexed. Allows duplicate members....when creating a tuple with one item, 
# add comma after the item
thistuple = ("mango","pear","mango")
print(thistuple)

print(2+3)
print(9-0)
print(type(9/3))
